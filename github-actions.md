GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub that allows developers to automate their software development workflows. It is a built-in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) service that enables you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub.

With GitHub Actions, you can create workflows that trigger a series of automated tasks when specific events occur in your GitHub repository, such as when code is pushed, pull requests are opened or closed, issues are created or resolved, and many others.

These workflows can be customized to suit your specific needs, and can include tasks such as running tests, building and deploying applications, publishing packages, and more. GitHub Actions supports a wide range of programming languages, and provides a variety of pre-built actions that you can use to build your workflows.

Overall, GitHub Actions can help you streamline your development process, increase collaboration and productivity, and automate repetitive tasks so you can focus on writing code.

The first step to setup a pipeline on Github Actions, is to create .github/workflows folder

Then, in a .yaml format, setup your build.
